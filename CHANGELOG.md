# 2.0.0

## Features

 - All code follows Google javascript style guide
 - Target url can be provided with query string
 - Events **fileAdded** and **filesAdded** can prevent file from being added to $.files list by
 returning false. Custom validators can be ran here.
 - **ResumableFile.getType()** and **ResumableFile.getExtension()** helper methods added. Can be
 used for custom validation.
 - **fileProgress** and **progress** events are always asynchronous.
 - **ResumableFile.pause()** and **ResumableFile.resume()** methods for single file pausing and
 resuming.
 - **filesSubmitted** event added. Can be used to start file upload. Event is thrown then files are
 added to queue.
 - **progressCallbacksInterval** parameter added. Minimum interval between callbacks execution in
  milliseconds.
 - **averageSpeed** and **currentSpeed** parameters added for `ResumableFile`. These params
 accuracy can be adjusted with `speedSmoothingFactor` and `progressCallbacksInterval` parameters.
 - **timeRemaining** method added for `ResumableFile`. Returns remaining time to upload in seconds. Accuracy is based on average speed.
 - **sizeUploaded** method added for `ResumableFile`. Returns size uploaded in bytes.
 - **singleFile** parameter added. Then enabled, uploaded file will replace current one.

## Breaking Changes

 - **ResumableFile.fileName** parameter renamed to **ResumableFile.name**
 - **Resumable.getOpt** method dropped, use Resumable.opts parameter instead if needed.
 - **Resumable.maxFiles**, **Resumable.minFileSize**, **Resumable.maxFileSize**,
 **Resumable.fileType** validators dropped. Use **fileAdded** and **filesAdded** events for
 custom validation.
 - **fileProgress** and **progress** events are not thrown on ResumableFile.abort() and ResumableFile.cancel() methods execution.
 - **cancel** event was removed. Event was always called after **Resumable.cancel()** function.
 - **fileAdded**, **filesAdded** events are thrown before file is added to upload queue. This means
 that calling **Resumable.upload()** method in these events will not start uploading current
 files. To start upload use **filesSubmitted** event instead.
 - **throttleProgressCallbacks** parameter was replaced with **progressCallbacksInterval** and it
  is now measured in milliseconds.
